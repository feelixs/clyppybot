## 💻 Development Setup

### ⚠️ Important Notice for Contributors

**This bot requires access to private API infrastructure (`clyppy.io` and `felixcreations.com`) that is not publicly available** - but the source code is open for transparency, education, and contributions.

**What you CAN do:**

As a contributor you can still run a test instance of the bot to confirm funcionality. Set the environment variable `CONTRIB_INSTANCE=1` in the Dockerfile before building. This variable will enable contributor mode, where the bot will log certain events instead of calling its external API. For example, instead of uploading a video to clyppy.io, it will send a log. What this means:

- All **large videos** will not be processed by a contributor bot instance
- All **small videos** (below 8mb) will be processed normally and uploaded to Discord.
